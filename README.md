# PASSWORD-GENERATOR
This C program generates a random password based on user-defined length. First, the user is prompted to enter the desired length of the password. If the length is greater than zero, the generatePassword function is called. This function utilizes a string of characters that includes uppercase and lowercase letters, digits, and special characters. Using the rand() function, it selects random characters from this string to create the password. The generated password is then printed to the console. If the user enters a non-positive number for the password length, the program displays an error message. To use this code, simply compile and run the program, input your desired password length, and it will generate a random password for you!
